Mathematica 2048 game. Created by AlephAlpha.

# How to Run

0. The code ( at least, the origin version ) contains UTF-8 characters. You may need UTF-8 environment in OS and Mathematica...

1. Get Mathematica. 9.0+ version recommanded.

2. I don't have a Mathematica environment now, only code.. so I just place the code in a text file. 
Copy the code into Mathematica, (click the code, )press Shift+Enter to run the code.

3. Click the blank at the right side of the generated graphic. Play as usual 2048 game ^_^
